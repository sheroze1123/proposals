## Galaxy Collision Simulation

### Introduction 

Galaxy simulations fall under the category of simulating physicals systems represented by particle models. Specifically, this is a correlated system where each element can have a mass, radius, velocity, position and acceleration. 

At each time step of the system, the velocity, position and acceleration attributes of an element need to be updated. These attributes for a single element depend on every other elements in the system. 


### Project Goal

For large number of elements, the computational cost of advancing the system over a large time period can be significant if the simulation is limited to the serial computing domain. 

This project aims to use the techniques of shared memory programming, message passing, vectorization to leverage the computational capability of the Totient cluster to improve the performance of the simulation. 

The simulation will employ a time integration scheme that would be optimized to fit the parallel programming model on the cluster. Specifically, we aim to explore a parallel particle mesh method to rapidly calculate the gravitational potential on a mesh using an FFT to solve Poissonâ€™s equation from the mass distribution.

Furthermore, if time permits, this project aims to explore various visualization approaches including interactive 
initial conditions.
